## About <a name = "about"></a>

The purpose of this project is to create a FastAPI endpoint that accepts a dictionary and responds with a JSON representation of the dictionary. Additionally, the API will be secured with JWT authentication, ensuring that only users with a valid JWT token can access the endpoint.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes. To get started, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

    Python 
    Docker (for containerization)

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/meghana2002/FastAPI_demo_app

```

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd FastAPI demo app

```
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

```

Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Running the FastAPI Application

To run the FastAPI application locally, use the following command:

```
python main.py

```
Running the Application in a Docker Container

To run the application in a Docker container, ensure that you have Docker installed and running on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

```
docker build -t myfastapi2 .

```

Run the docker container:
```
docker run -p 8000:8000 myfastapi2

```
The FastAPI application will now be accessible at http://localhost:8000.


### Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To access the API endpoint, make a POST request to http://localhost:8000/api/dictionary with a valid JWT token passed in the Authorization header as a bearer token.

Example using curl:

```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/api/dictionary' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "key1": "value1",
  "key2": "value2",
  "key3": "value3"
}'


```
The API will respond with a JSON representation of the dictionary provided in the request.

Unit Tests

To run the unit tests for the API endpoints, use the following command:

```
pytest tests/

```
The unit tests include mocked authentication to simulate both authenticated and unauthenticated scenarios.
